# Head First Design Pattern

## Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate then from what stays the same
- Favor composition over inheritance(has-a vs is-a)
- Program to an interface(subtype), not an implementation
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Open-Closed principle(Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification)
- Dependency Inversion Principle(Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes)
- Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends(Law of Demeter)
- The Hollywood Principle(Don’t call us, we’ll call you)
- A class should have only one reason to change
