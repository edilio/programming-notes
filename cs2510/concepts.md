# Concepts

- Interfaces(union structures)
- Dynamic dispatch
- Self-referential structures(List, Tree)
- Generics(abstraction over types)
- Delegation
- Helper functions
- Object functions
- Accumulators for recursive algorithms
- How to use interfaces to create `Predicates`, `Comparators` and `IFuncs` so we can see how to refactor `Generic` Lists to have `filter`, `sort`, `map` and `foldr`(reduce).
- Double dispatch(For SameXXX and for visitor pattern)
- Mutations(side effects)
- Aliasing(when two variables refer to the same object)
- Cycle data structures(direct and indirect)
- Iterables
