# How we can use OO Design Patterns to implement an E-Commerce application

## Strategy Pattern

The `Strategy` pattern can be useful for cases where you need to vary the behavior of a system based on different business rules or policies. For example, you might use the `Strategy` pattern to implement different pricing strategies for different products or to handle shipping in different ways for different regions.

Here's an example of how you might use the `Strategy` pattern in an e-commerce application:

- Define an interface for the algorithm you want to implement (e.g. `PricingStrategy`, `ShippingStrategy`).
- Create concrete implementations of the algorithm for each variation you want to support (e.g. `DiscountPricingStrategy`, `StandardPricingStrategy`, `LocalShippingStrategy`, `InternationalShippingStrategy`).
- In your e-commerce application, create a class (e.g. `Product`, `Order`) that needs to use one of the algorithms. This class should have a field for storing a reference to the algorithm and a method for setting the algorithm (e.g. `set_pricing_strategy`, `set_shipping_strategy`).
- To use a particular algorithm, create an instance of the desired concrete strategy and pass it to the object using the appropriate setter method.

You can also use the `Strategy` design pattern to handle different payment methods in an e-commerce application. The basic approach would be similar to the examples I provided earlier:

- Define an interface for the payment method algorithm (e.g. `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentProcessor`).
- Create concrete implementations of the algorithm for each payment method you want to support (e.g. `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `BankTransferPayment`).
- In your e-commerce application, create a class (e.g. `Order`, `Transaction`) that needs to use a payment method. This class should have a field for storing a reference to the payment method algorithm and a method for setting the payment method (e.g. `set_payment_method`, `select_payment_processor`).
- To use a particular payment method, create an instance of the desired concrete strategy and pass it to the object using the appropriate setter method.

## Command Pattern

`Command` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to decouple the object that invokes an operation (the client) from the object that performs the operation (the receiver). For example, you might use the `Command` pattern to implement a shopping cart that allows a user to add, remove, and view the items in their cart, or to implement an order system that allows an administrator to cancel, modify, or view orders.

Here's an example of how you might use the `Command` pattern in an e-commerce application:

Define an interface for the command (e.g. `Command`, `Action`).
Create concrete implementations of the command for each operation you want to support (e.g. `AddToCartCommand`, `RemoveFromCartCommand`, `ViewCartCommand`, `CancelOrderCommand`, `ModifyOrderCommand`, `ViewOrderCommand`).
In your e-commerce application, create a class (e.g. `ShoppingCart`, `OrderSystem`) that needs to use the commands. This class should have a method for executing a command (e.g. `execute_command`, `perform_action`).
To invoke a particular command, create an instance of the desired concrete command and pass it to the object using the appropriate execution method.
Here's an example of how you might implement the Command pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass

class AddToCartCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, shopping_cart, product):
        self.shopping_cart = shopping_cart
        self.product = product
        
    def execute(self):
        self.shopping_cart.add_to_cart(self.product)

class RemoveFromCartCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, shopping_cart, product):
        self.shopping_cart = shopping_cart
        self.product = product
        
    def execute(self):
        self.shopping_cart.remove_from_cart(self.product)

class ViewCartCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, shopping_cart):
        self.shopping_cart = shopping_cart
        
    def execute(self):
        self.shopping_cart.view_cart()

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        
    def add_to_cart(self, product):
        self.items.append(product)
        
    def remove_from_cart(self, product):
        self.items.remove(product)
        
    def view_cart(self):
        for item in self.items:
            print(item)
```

## Observer Pattern

The `Observer` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to notify multiple parties about changes to an object, such as updates to a product's availability or price. For example, you might use the `Observer` pattern to implement a notification system that sends email updates to customers when a product they are interested in becomes available, or to update the display of a product's availability on the website in real-time.

Here's an example of how you might use the `Observer` pattern in an e-commerce application:

- Define an interface for the observer (e.g. `Observer`, `Subscriber`).
- Create concrete implementations of the observer for each type of notification you want to support (e.g. `EmailSubscriber`, `SMSSubscriber`, `WebhookSubscriber`).
- Define a class for the subject (e.g. `Product`, `Inventory`) and give it methods for attaching and detaching observers, and for notifying observers when its state changes (e.g. `attach`, `detach`, `notify`).
- In your e-commerce application, create instances of the subject and observer classes and attach the observers to the subject using the appropriate method.
- When the state of the subject changes, call the notify method to update the observers.

Here's an example of how you might implement the Observer pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, subject):
        pass

class EmailSubscriber(Observer):
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email
        
    def update(self, subject):
        print(f'Sending email to {self.email} about {subject.name}')

class SMSSubscriber(Observer):
    def __init__(self, phone_number):
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        
    def update(self, subject):
        print(f'Sending SMS to {self.phone_number} about {subject.name}')

class WebhookSubscriber(Observer):
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        
    def update(self, subject):
        print(f'Sending webhook to {self.url} about {subject.name}')

class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []
        self.name = None
        
    def attach(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)
        
    def detach(self, observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)
        
    def notify(self):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update(self)

class Product(Subject):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.notify()
```

You could also use the `Observer` pattern to implement an event source inventory system in order to create different projections of the inventory. For example, you might want to create a projection of the inventory that is optimized for querying the availability of a product, and another projection that is optimized for querying the price of a product. You could use the Observer pattern to implement this system by creating a subject class for the inventory and an observer class for each projection.

## Memento Pattern?

Here's an example of how you might use the `Memento` pattern in an e-commerce application:

The user adds a product to their shopping cart.
- The system creates a `Memento` object that captures the state of the shopping cart before the product was added.
- If the user decides to remove the product from their cart, the system can use the `Memento` object to restore the cart to its previous state.
- To implement the `Memento` pattern, you'll need to define a `Memento` class that captures the internal state of the object you want to store. You'll also need to define a `Caretaker` class that is responsible for managing the `Memento` objects.

Here's an example of how you might implement the `Memento` and `Caretaker` classes in `Python`:
    
```python
class Memento:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state

class Caretaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mementos = []

    def add_memento(self, memento):
        self.mementos.append(memento)

    def get_memento(self, index):
        return self.mementos[index]
```

To use the `Memento` and `Caretaker` classes in your e-commerce application, you would first create an instance of the `Caretaker` class. Then, whenever a user performs an action that you want to allow them to undo, you would create a new `Memento` object and pass it to the `Caretaker` using the `add_memento` method. To revert to a previous state, you can retrieve the appropriate `Memento` object using the `get_memento` method and use it to restore the state of the relevant object.


## State Pattern

The `State` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to change the behavior of an object based on its internal state. For example, you might use the `State` pattern to implement a checkout process that behaves differently depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

`State machines` are a useful tool for modeling and implementing the behavior of complex systems, including e-commerce systems. Here are some ways you might use state machines in an e-commerce context:

1. Order management: You can use a state machine to model the various states an order can be in (e.g., "pending," "shipped," "delivered," etc.) and the transitions between those states (e.g., an order transitions from "pending" to "shipped" when the shipping label is generated).
2. Inventory management: You can use a state machine to model the various states an item can be in (e.g., "in stock," "out of stock," "on hold," etc.) and the transitions between those states (e.g., an item transitions from "in stock" to "out of stock" when it is purchased).
3. Customer accounts: You can use a state machine to model the various states a customer account can be in (e.g., "active," "suspended," "closed," etc.) and the transitions between those states (e.g., an account transitions from "active" to "suspended" when the customer misses a payment).

To implement a state machine in an e-commerce system, you can use a library or framework that provides support for state machine modeling and execution, such as the Apache Commons State Machine library or the Spring State Machine framework. Alternatively, you can implement a state machine manually using a programming language of your choice.

## Proxy Pattern

The `Proxy` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to add additional functionality to an existing object without modifying the object itself. For example, you might use the `Proxy` pattern to implement a caching system that stores the results of expensive operations so that they can be retrieved quickly the next time they are needed.

Also, the `Proxy` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to control access to an object. For example, you might use the `Proxy` pattern to implement a system that allows users to access a product's details only if they are logged in.

However, I think it will also be useful to get a live inventory from suppliers. For example, if a product is out of stock, you might want to check with the supplier to see if they have any in stock. You could use the `Proxy` pattern to implement this system by creating a proxy class that acts as an interface to the supplier's inventory system.

## Decorator Pattern

The `Decorator` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to add additional functionality to a product or service, such as adding gift wrapping or a personalized message. For example, you might use the `Decorator` pattern to implement a system that allows a customer to add extra features to their order, such as expedited shipping or insurance.

Here's an example of how you might use the `Decorator` pattern in an e-commerce application:

- Define an interface for the decorator (e.g. `Decorator`, `Enhancement`).
- Create concrete implementations of the decorator for each type of enhancement you want to offer (e.g. `GiftWrappingDecorator`, `PersonalizedMessageDecorator`, `ExpeditedShippingDecorator`, `InsuranceDecorator`).
- Define a base class for the object you want to enhance (e.g. `Product`, `Service`) and implement the interface defined in step 1.
- In your e-commerce application, create instances of the decorator and base class and use the decorator to wrap the base class object.
- To add a particular enhancement to an object, create an instance of the desired decorator and pass it the object you want to enhance as an argument.

## Adapter Pattern

We could use it for `PromoStandards` for the different versions and other APIs like `SageWorld`

## Builder Pattern

A builder Pattern can be use for creating complex objects like `Order` because an order class has several attributes such as `customer`, `billingA_address`, `shipping_address`, `items`, `etc`.
You could use a `OrderBuilder` class to construct an `Order` object step by step, as follows:

```python
OrderBuilder.with_customer(customer).with_billing_address(billing_address).with_shipping_address(shipping_address).with_items(items).build()
```

This idea is already implemented in `SQlAlchemy` and `Django` ORM.


## Template Method Pattern

The `Template Method` pattern can be useful for cases where you want to define the steps of an algorithm without specifying the implementation of those steps. For example, you might use the `Template Method` pattern to implement a system that allows users to create their own product by selecting from a list of available options.

It is already implemented in `Django` and `Django Rest Framework` for `APIView` and `GenericAPIView` classes.

## Chain of Responsibility pattern In e-commerce

The `Chain of Responsibility` pattern is a design pattern that allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects, with each object in the chain having the opportunity to handle the request or pass it on to the next object in the chain. This can be useful in e-commerce applications to allow different components of the system to handle different types of requests or to process requests in a specific order.

For example, in an e-commerce system, a request to place an order may need to be handled by several components. The request might first be passed to a component that checks the availability of the items in the order and ensures that the customer's billing information is correct. If these checks pass, the request might be passed to a component that calculates the shipping costs and adds them to the order total. Finally, the request might be passed to a component that processes the payment and confirms the order.

Using the `Chain of Responsibility` pattern can help to decouple the components of an e-commerce system, making it easier to add or modify the behavior of individual components without affecting the overall system. It can also help to ensure that requests are handled in a consistent and predictable manner.

## Flyweight pattern for e-commerce application?

The `Flyweight` pattern could potentially be used in an e-commerce application to improve performance and reduce memory usage. The `Flyweight` pattern is a design pattern that allows objects with similar or repeating state to be shared, rather than creating a new object each time. This can be particularly useful in situations where there are a large number of objects with similar or repeating state, as it can help to reduce the amount of memory required to store these objects.

In an e-commerce application, the `Flyweight` pattern could potentially be used to optimize the storage and retrieval of product information. For example, an e-commerce application might have a large number of products, each with a set of attributes such as name, price, and description. Instead of creating a separate object for each product, the Flyweight pattern could be used to create a single object that stores the common attributes for all products and allows the unique attributes to be stored externally. This could help to reduce the amount of memory required to store product information, improving the overall performance of the application.

It's worth noting that the `Flyweight` pattern is most effective when used in situations where there are a large number of objects with similar or repeating state, and where the overhead of creating and managing these objects is significant. In e-commerce applications, it may be worth considering the use of the Flyweight pattern if you have a large number of products with similar attributes, or if you are experiencing performance issues related to the storage and retrieval of product information.

##  Interpreter design pattern in the context of e-commerce?

The `Interpreter` design pattern could potentially be used in an e-commerce application to process and interpret requests or commands. The Interpreter design pattern is a design pattern that defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to translate the language into a form that can be understood and executed by a computer.

In the context of an e-commerce application, the `Interpreter` design pattern could be used to process and interpret requests or commands related to various aspects of the application, such as search queries, order processing, and customer service. For example, an e-commerce application might use an interpreter to process and interpret search queries from customers, returning relevant results based on the specific terms and criteria specified in the query. The interpreter could also be used to process and interpret requests to place an order, determining the availability of the items in the order and calculating the total cost based on shipping and tax information.

Using the `Interpreter` design pattern can help to make it easier to process and interpret requests or commands within an e-commerce application, as it provides a structured way to define and translate the language used to express these requests. It can also make it easier to modify or extend the capabilities of the application, as new commands or requests can be added or modified by updating the interpreter.

## Mediator

The `Mediator` design pattern could potentially be used in an e-commerce application to facilitate communication and coordination between different components or objects within the system. The `Mediator` design pattern is a design pattern that defines an object that acts as a mediator between other objects, allowing them to communicate with each other without having to depend on each other directly.

In the context of an e-commerce application, the `Mediator` design pattern could be used to facilitate communication and coordination between different components or objects that are responsible for different aspects of the application, such as order processing, payment processing, and customer service. For example, an e-commerce application might use a mediator to coordinate the communication between a payment processing component and an order processing component, allowing the two components to communicate and share information without having to depend on each other directly.

Using the `Mediator` design pattern can help to reduce the complexity and dependency of the components within an e-commerce application, as it allows them to communicate through a central point of coordination rather than directly with each other. It can also make it easier to modify or extend the application, as new components or functionality can be added by updating the mediator rather than directly modifying the other components.

## Composite pattern

The composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures and treat them uniformly. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Here's an example of how you could use the composite design pattern in an e-commerce application:

Imagine you have a `Category` class that represents a category of products on an e-commerce website. A category can contain subcategories, and each subcategory can contain further subcategories, forming a tree structure.

You could use the composite design pattern to represent this tree structure as follows:
```java
abstract class Category {
  protected String name;

  public Category(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public abstract void add(Category category);
  public abstract void remove(Category category);
  public abstract void display(int depth);
}

class LeafCategory extends Category {
  public LeafCategory(String name) {
    super(name);
  }

  @Override
  public void add(Category category) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }

  @Override
  public void remove(Category category) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }

  @Override
  public void display(int depth) {
    for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
      System.out.print("-");
    }
    System.out.println(name);
  }
}

class CompositeCategory extends Category {
  private List<Category> categories = new ArrayList<>();

  public CompositeCategory(String name) {
    super(name);
  }

  @Override
  public void add(Category category) {
    categories.add(category);
  }

  @Override
  public void remove(Category category) {
    categories.remove(category);
  }

  @Override
  public void display(int depth) {
    for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
      System.out.print("-");
    }
    System.out.println(name);
    for (Category category : categories) {
      category.display(depth + 2);
    }
  }
}
```

Another example will be with products.

Imagine you have a `Product` class that represents a product on an e-commerce website. Some products can be composed of other products, forming a tree structure. For example, a laptop might be composed of a processor, a motherboard, a hard drive, and so on.

You could use the `composite` design pattern to represent this tree structure as follows:

```java
abstract class Product {
  protected String name;
  protected double price;

  public Product(String name, double price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  public abstract void add(Product product);
  public abstract void remove(Product product);
  public abstract double getPrice();
}

class SimpleProduct extends Product {
  public SimpleProduct(String name, double price) {
    super(name, price);
  }

  @Override
  public void add(Product product) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }

  @Override
  public void remove(Product product) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }

  @Override
  public double getPrice() {
    return price;
  }
}

class CompositeProduct extends Product {
  private List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

  public CompositeProduct(String name) {
    super(name, 0);
  }

  @Override
  public void add(Product product) {
    products.add(product);
    price += product.getPrice();
  }

  @Override
  public void remove(Product product) {
    products.remove(product);
    price -= product.getPrice();
  }

  @Override
  public double getPrice() {
    return price;
  }
}
```

The `Product` class is an abstract class that represents a product. It has three abstract methods: `add()`, `remove()`, and `getPrice()`.

The `SimpleProduct` class represents a leaf node in the tree, i.e., a product that is not composed of other products. It extends the `Product` class and provides a concrete implementation for the `getPrice()` method.

The `CompositeProduct` class represents a composite node in the tree, i.e., a product that is composed of other products. It also extends the `Product` class and provides concrete implementations for the `add()`, `remove()`, and `getPrice()` methods. It maintains a list of its component products and delegates the `add()`, `remove()`, and `getPrice()` methods to the component products.

To use the `Product` classes to construct a tree of products, you can do the following:

```java
Product processor = new SimpleProduct("Intel Core i7", 199.99);
Product motherboard = new SimpleProduct("Asus ROG Strix B550-F", 199.99);
Product hardDrive = new SimpleProduct("Seagate Barracuda 2TB", 99.99);
Product laptop = new CompositeProduct("Asus ROG Strix G15");
laptop.add(processor);
laptop.add(motherboard);
laptop.add(hardDrive);

System.out.println("Total price: " + laptop.getPrice());
```
