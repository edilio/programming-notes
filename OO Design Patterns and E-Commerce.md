# How we can use OO Design Patterns to implement E-Commerce

## How to use Memento Pattern in e-commerce?

The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture the internal state of an object without violating the object's encapsulation. It can be useful in an e-commerce context in cases where you want to allow a user to revert their actions, or to allow an administrator to undo changes that were made to the system.

Here's an example of how you might use the Memento pattern in an e-commerce application:

The user adds a product to their shopping cart.
- The system creates a Memento object that captures the state of the shopping cart before the product was added.
- If the user decides to remove the product from their cart, the system can use the Memento object to restore the cart to its previous state.
- To implement the Memento pattern, you'll need to define a Memento class that captures the internal state of the object you want to store. You'll also need to define a Caretaker class that is responsible for managing the Memento objects.

Here's an example of how you might implement the `Memento` and `Caretaker` classes in Python:
    
```python
class Memento:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state

class Caretaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mementos = []

    def add_memento(self, memento):
        self.mementos.append(memento)

    def get_memento(self, index):
        return self.mementos[index]
```

To use the Memento and Caretaker classes in your e-commerce application, you would first create an instance of the Caretaker class. Then, whenever a user performs an action that you want to allow them to undo, you would create a new Memento object and pass it to the Caretaker using the add_memento method. To revert to a previous state, you can retrieve the appropriate Memento object using the get_memento method and use it to restore the state of the relevant object.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
